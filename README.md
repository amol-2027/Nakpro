# GSAP Awwwards Website Clone  

This project is a **creative animated website** built using **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** along with **React** and **TailwindCSS**.  
I created it as a practice project to explore modern animation techniques and smooth transitions.  

The project was developed for **Nakpro Brand**, aiming to provide an engaging, interactive, and visually appealing user experience inspired by **Awwwards-winning websites**.
